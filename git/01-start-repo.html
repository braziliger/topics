    <h2>First steps</h2>
    <p>There are a few different ways you might want to initialize a repository. There are three cases I can think of -</p>
    <ol>
        <li>You have not started coding, and want to create a blank repo to start adding code to</li>
        <li>You have pre-existing code that you want to add to a repo, which you have not created yet</li>
        <li>You want to start working on a pre-existing repository that has code in it</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So we'll go over a few simple steps - first, how to create a repository on <a href="https://www.github.com">GitHub</a>. You
        are probably thinking "I already know this"! But read it anyway.
    </p>
    <p>Then, we'll go over those three cases, and how to manage each case.</p>

    <h2>Creating a repository</h2>
    <p>
        To create a repository, go to <a href="https://www.github.com">GitHub</a> and log in. The first screen you see should look
        something like this:
    </p>
    <img src="./img02.jpg" width="60%">
    <p>
        Click on the "new" button and you'll be presented with a screen like this:
    </p>
    <img src="./img03.jpg" width="60%">
    <p>Let's go over these fields:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Repository name</b> is obviously the name of your repo</li>
        <li><b>Description</b> is nice to fill out if you're creating a public repo; if it's private that's really up to you</li>
        <li><b>Public/Private</b> dictates if random people on GitHub will be able to locate & clone your code or not</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Notice the line that says <b>Skip this step if you're importing an existing repository</b>. If you have pre-existing
        code that you're wanting to add to a new repo, don't touch anything below this line. Otherwise, if you're working clean (you
        have no code yet):
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Add a README file</b> will do what it says - add a README.md file to your repository. More on this soon</li>
        <li><b>Add .gitignore</b> will add a special file called .gitignore to your repository. In this file, you can add
        paths to files that you do <b>not</b> want Git to track. More on this later on as well</li>
        <li><b>Choose a license</b> allows you to pick a license to add to your repo that tells people what they can/cannot
            do with your code; important if this is a public repo, and you can read up on what different licenses do on your own.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>README.md</h3>
    <p>
        This file contains useful information about your repo that shows up on the splash page for the repo. It can have
        anything from introductory information to setup instructions. It's the stuff that shows up here:
