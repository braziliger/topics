    <h2>What is Git?</h2>
    <p>
        Git is version control software. The specific job of Git is to track <b>changes in a codebase</b>. Here's a basic
        overview of the workflow of Git:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Create a new repository, or find a pre-existing repository you want to work on</li>
        <li>"Clone" the repository to your local machine</li>
        <li>Make a change to the repository by adding, deleting, or modifying a file in the repository</li>
        <li>"Commit" the change you made to the repository</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 3 & 4 until you are ready to publish your changes</li>
        <li>"Push" the changes you made to the remote repository</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        There are obviously variations to this list but that's generally how it works. So, I'm building this site to walk you
            through how to use git. The next section will explain how to use Git in a very basic sense and will build up to more complex stuff.<br>
        I think we've gone over some of this before but go over it again, and practice it! That's the only way you'll learn it.
