    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This section contains useful information about how to use Git. You should have Git Bash installed.<br>
    The page is mostly broken up into sections which represent different commands you'll use in Git.<br>
    Some lessons go over how to do some basic stuff with Git, like creating a repo on the site.<br>
    Generally, these commands are meant to be executed from your Git Bash command prompt.<br>
    Learning to use the commands through the command prompt gives you more granular control of what Git does/is doing,
        and while it is more complicated to learn, it will help you better understand how Git operates. Once you know how to operate
        Git using the command line, you can let your IDE handle this stuff. If you start by using Git through the IDE,
        you won't really understand what's happening behind the scenes, which is no bueno.<br>
    These are meant to be read in order so make sure you understand each topic before moving to the next!</p>
